The folder "Codes" contains all codes utilized to generate the plots or data in 
"Towards a more accurate quasi-static approximation of the electric potential for neurostimulation with kilohertz-frequency sources"
(T. Caussade, E. Paduro, M. Courdurier, E. Cerpa, W.E Grill, L.E Medina)

### Basic Example.

The jupyter notebook 
-> Basic Example.ipynb 
contains an example to run a single experiment.

All files the other files employ the same scheme to run.

### Functionalities
The functionalities are contained in the "inh_src" folder.

-> inh_src\xxx.py

The MRG model fiber .hoc files are in the "MRG" file.

### Running the experiments ("exp_title.py" files)

Suggestion: all experiments should be slightly modified properly to save data as-you-go.

Current-distance curves
-> exp_current_distance.py

Strength-duration curves
-> exp_strength_duration.py

Action potentials by trains of pulses recording 
-> exp_repetitive_stimulation.py

Block thresholds curves
-> exp_conduction_block.py

### Figures ("figxxx_title.py" files).

Code employed to generate all the figures in the paper.
